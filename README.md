# Early-warning-system-for-glacier-lake-outburst-flood
An Early Warning System (EWS) for Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) uses sensors, satellite data, and hydrological models to monitor glacial lakes and predict flood risks. It provides timely alerts to at-risk populations, allowing for evacuation and disaster preparedness, helping reduce loss of life and damage from GLOFs.
